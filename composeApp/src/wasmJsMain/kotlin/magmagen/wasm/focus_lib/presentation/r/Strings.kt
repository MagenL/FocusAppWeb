Unlike traditional UI frameworks, where focus behavior is often implicitly handled, Jetpack Compose requires explicit management to ensure focus restoration, movement, and accessibility. When items enter or leave the composition, maintaining the correct focus state can be difficult. Additionally, restoring focus when navigating between screens adds complexity, as recomposition can cause the loss of manually managed focus states. Developers need to implement mechanisms to save and restore focus when switching views to ensure a seamless user experience. This library provides a structured way to manage focus within LazyColumn, LazyRow, and LazyGrid, ensuring a smooth and predictable experience.",
